# Introduction to the assignment

In this assignment we have been given a dataset storing the training and test results for different subjects 
while performing different activities. The aim of my script is to merge together the different datasets and clean
this final table from any measurement we are not interested in. 
In particular:

* we need to merge three datasets for each set, be it train or test;
* we need to relabel the columns of each of these sets and merge them together;
* extract the mean and standard deviations measurements, keeping track of the activity id and the subject id;
* the script finally returns a new tidy dataset printed in a file.
